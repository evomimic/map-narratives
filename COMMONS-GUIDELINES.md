# 🌱 MAP Narratives: Commons Participation Guidelines

This repository is part of a broader movement toward **memetic commoning** — the co-creation, stewardship, and evolution of shared language, frameworks, and understanding in support of regenerative coordination.

MAP is not a product. It is a living architecture — a pattern-language, a set of protocols, and a collective experiment in trustable, sovereignty-respecting collaboration.  
This wiki is one of its public **Agent Spaces** — a context where people and knowledge come into relationship.

We invite all contributors to engage not just as consumers of content, but as **Agents in a Promise Weave** — shaping, refining, and remixing the collective narrative through their own contributions.

## 🌀 Core Practices

Participation here is guided not just by a license, but by a **memetic ethos** — a pattern of care and reciprocity in how we hold and evolve shared meaning.

We ask that you:

- 🧬 **Honor the living nature of the commons**  
  See this content not as fixed doctrine, but as evolving narrative — a reflection of a community in motion.

- 🧠 **Credit the broader Agent Weave**  
  When referencing or extending material, acknowledge the MAP context and the community behind it. You’re building on a collective body of care.

- 🔁 **Contribute flows back into the commons**  
  If you adapt a framing, expand a metaphor, or create something new from this work, consider offering it back as a form of reciprocal value flow.

- 🔐 **Respect sovereignty, resist enclosure**  
  Don’t turn shared narrative into proprietary fences. Keep adaptations open and remixable — in spirit and in license.

- 🌐 **Amplify diversity of expression**  
  Help make MAP narratives legible to different memetic lineages. Translate between frames. Build bridges between communities of practice.
