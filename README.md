# map-narratives
A "wikis-only" repo that provides a place to evolve narratives about the MAP without adding bulk to the map-holons repo.

## üåÄ About This Repository

This repository is a **commons-aligned knowledge resource** in support of the Memetic Activation Platform (MAP). It contains narratives, metaphors, framings, and descriptive patterns intended to make MAP accessible to a range of audiences ‚Äî from civic innovators and mutual aid organizers to systems thinkers, technologists, and funders.

We think of this repo not just as documentation, but as a **living, evolving memetic commons** ‚Äî a shared language-space for articulating new social logics and organizing principles. You're invited to adapt, remix, and extend these materials in the spirit of care, reciprocity, and the co-creation of shared meaning.

## üîÑ Lifecycle & Publishing

This repository is maintained as a **living document**, evolving alongside the MAP project. Contributions can be made through pull requests or direct edits (if you have write access), and changes are published using [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/), a static site generator optimized for project documentation.

**View the Live Site**: You can browse the latest published version of this narrative at: **[evomimic.github.io/map-narratives](https://evomimic.github.io/map-narratives/)**

**Local Development**: To preview changes locally before publishing: `mkdocs serve`

This will start a local web server (usually at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`) where you can view your changes live as you edit.

**Publishing Updates**: To publish the latest version of the site to GitHub Pages: use `mkdocs gh-deploy`. This will automatically build the static site and push it to the `gh-pages` branch for GitHub Pages hosting.
