# map-narratives
A "wikis-only" repo that provides a place to evolve narratives about the MAP without adding bulk to the map-holons repo.

## üåÄ About This Repository

This repository is a **commons-aligned knowledge resource** in support of the Memetic Activation Platform (MAP). It contains narratives, metaphors, framings, and descriptive patterns intended to make MAP accessible to a range of audiences ‚Äî from civic innovators and mutual aid organizers to systems thinkers, technologists, and funders.

We think of this repo not just as documentation, but as a **living, evolving memetic commons** ‚Äî a shared language-space for articulating new social logics and organizing principles. You're invited to adapt, remix, and extend these materials in the spirit of care, reciprocity, and the co-creation of shared meaning.
