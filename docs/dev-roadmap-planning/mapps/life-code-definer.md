# LifeCode Definer

_‚ÄúWhat values and patterns do I stand for?‚Äù_

The LifeCode Definer enables agents to curate and express the values, norms, and memes that guide their behavior within a Space. It draws from the shared Meme Pool and creates personalized LifeCodes aligned with collective intentions.

LifeCodes serve as memetic DNA for both individuals and groups:

- For **individual agents**, a LifeCode reflects personal values, principles, and affiliations.
- For **collectives (Spaces, crews, or services)**, a LifeCode encodes shared norms and commitments ‚Äî including alignment with [ProSocial design principles](https://www.prosocial.world/prosocial-themes). These serve as a declaration of group intent and a basis for trust and cooperation.
- For **Offers**, LifeCodes communicate the underlying promise and ethos of the product or service, helping potential collaborators or recipients assess value alignment.
