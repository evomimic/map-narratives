# MAP Minimum Viable Mapps (MVP)

This section documents the core mapps that form the minimum viable release of the Memetic Activation Platform (MAP). Each mapp is a modular capability that enables agents to activate, navigate, and co-create within the ecosystem.

Below is the prioritized MVP implementation sequence. Click any mapp to explore its supported use cases, related HolonTypes, and associated Personas.

## üß± What‚Äôs a Mapp?

Mapps are modular, interdependent capabilities within the MAP ecosystem. Each enables a distinct form of interaction ‚Äî from identity creation to service composition to collective ritual. While they can be used independently, they are designed to be **mutually reinforcing**.
