# MAP Minimum Viable Mapps (MVP)

This section documents the core mapps that form the minimum viable release of the Memetic Activation Platform (MAP). Each mapp is a modular app or capability that enables agents to activate, navigate, and co-create within the ecosystem.

Below is the prioritized MVP list. Click any mapp to explore its functionality, purpose, and interactions.

## üß± What‚Äôs a Mapp?

Mapps are modular, interdependent capabilities within the MAP ecosystem. Each is focused on enabling a slice of interaction: from identity creation to ritual facilitation to service publishing. They may be used independently but are designed to become **mutually reinforcing**.
