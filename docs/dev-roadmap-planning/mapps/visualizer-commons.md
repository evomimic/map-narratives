# Visualizer Commons

_“How do we see and interact with the living data of the MAP?”_

The Visualizer Commons is the dynamic, evolving library of tools that render MAP Holons for human experience. It powers DAHN—the Dynamic, Adaptive, Holon Navigator—by providing the visualizers that shape what agents see, do, and feel.

---

## ✨ Key Capabilities

- Provide rendering logic for different MAP Types (Holons, properties, relationships, collections)
- Match visualizers to user/system preferences at runtime via DAHN
- Support for type-specific and context-specific rendering (e.g., map, card, tree, table)
- Open contribution model: HX designers can publish visualizers into the commons

✅ **Outcome:** A modular, extensible UX framework that adapts to the context, data, and user
