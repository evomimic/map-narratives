# MAP Menu Structure & Supporting Flows

This document outlines the primary **Human Experience (HX)** structure of the MAP platform: the top-level menu system and the interaction flows each menu item enables. It reflects MAP’s core philosophy of agent sovereignty, memetic expression, and trust-based coordination—expressed through practical, actionable entry points.

---

## 🍽️ Primary Menu Picks

These are the top-level navigation items a user might encounter in their I-Space interface. Each corresponds to a cluster of user intents and interaction flows.

| Menu Label | Description | Example User Intent |
|------------|-------------|---------------------|
| 🌀 **My I-Space** | Enter and shape your sovereign space | "This is where I reflect, define, and evolve" |
| 🧬 **My LifeCode** | Define, update, or publish your memetic signature | "I want to articulate my values and signal them" |
| 📦 **My Apps** | Add or remove apps within your membrane | "I want to visualize data, journal, or co-create" |
| 🔔 **My Signals** | Manage notifications, preferences, and feeds | "I want to control what reaches me" |
| 🗃️ **My Expressions** | View or manage ideas, media, documents, and offers you’ve created | "Where are my writings, offers, prototypes?" |
| 🧭 **Discover** | Explore offers, We-Spaces, and missions | "What's happening out there that I might care about?" |
| 🤝 **My Relationships** | View current agreements and shared AgentSpaces | "Who am I in relationship with, and under what terms?" |
| 🌱 **We-Spaces** | Join, create, or contribute to shared spaces | "I want to work with others I align with" |
| 🧠 **Meme Pool** | Browse, seed, or remix ideas, memes, and protocols | "I want to contribute ideas, or remix what others are doing" |
| ⚙️ **Settings** | Identity keys, device sync, backup, privacy settings | "Keep my stuff safe, portable, and private" |

## 🔄 Example Menu Flows

### 🌀 My I-Space

**Use Case:** Shape your environment and identity

1. View personal dashboard (apps, data, HX layout)
2. Add or remove apps
3. Visualize current expressions or drafts
4. Start new:
    - ✍️ Journal Entry
    - 🎨 Creative Expression
    - 🤝 Offer Draft
    - 📃 LifeCode Update

**Backed Use Cases:**
- Sovereign data space
- Adaptive app composition
- Self-expression

---

### 🧬 My LifeCode

**Use Case:** Define and evolve your values & memetic signature

1. View current LifeCode (latest version)
2. Edit → Save Draft → Commit
3. Compare with past versions or other agents
4. Choose where to publish it (We-Spaces, Offers, Profile)
5. Optional: fork someone else’s LifeCode and remix it

**Backed Use Cases:**
- Memetic expression
- Value alignment discovery
- Coherence-based matching

---

### 🧭 Discover

**Use Case:** Find what’s happening across MAP

1. Choose channel:
    - 🌐 Public Offers (Ambient Field)
    - 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 We-Spaces I’m eligible to join
    - 🌍 Bioregional or networked collectives
2. Apply filters:
    - “Aligned with my LifeCode”
    - “In my location”
    - “Offering services I need”
3. View details → Accept Offer → Create new AgreementSpace

**Backed Use Cases:**
- Offer discovery
- Low-trust entry points into MAP ecosystem
- Scaffolding toward new relationships

---

### 🌱 We-Spaces

**Use Case:** Join or co-create collective spaces

1. View spaces you belong to (with LifeCodes & protocols)
2. Search or discover new ones via Discover
3. Create new We-Space:
    - Define name, purpose, LifeCode (template or original)
    - Choose governance & roles
    - Invite others or publish invitation
4. Add apps to group (instead of joining a group *in* an app)

**Backed Use Cases:**
- Emergent group formation
- Cultural scaffolding
- Governance configuration

---

### 🧠 Meme Pool

**Use Case:** Seed and remix ideas, protocols, and tools

1. Browse public memes (ideas, templates, norms)
2. View forks, usage in We-Spaces
3. Remix into your own We-Space or Offer
4. Track propagation/evolution of your meme

**Backed Use Cases:**
- Cultural regeneration
- Protocol evolution
- Federated innovation

---

## 🔑 Design Principles

- Menus are **verb-forward**: *Discover*, *Offer*, *Join*, *Create*, *Express*
- Every interaction radiates from the **I-Space**: your sovereign core
- Users are never forced to reveal identity in order to explore
- Every flow honors **progressive disclosure**: start with presence, unfold into trust

## 🧭 Summary: What MAP Enables (As Experienced)

MAP isn’t just a protocol or a platform—it’s a **memetically-driven, human-centered coordination substrate** that allows you to:

1. **Be present** without surveillance
2. **Express identity** without surrender
3. **Find others** without central directories
4. **Build trust** without intermediaries
5. **Coordinate action** without permission
6. **Evolve structure** without top-down design

From “just me” to “trusted we,” MAP provides the scaffolding for a new kind of agency to emerge—one that is **self-authored**, **value-aligned**, and **in flow**.
