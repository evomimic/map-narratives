# Persona: Emergence Host

**Purpose:**  
Hold space for collective sensemaking and self-organization.

**Description:**  
The Emergence Host creates containers where something new can arise—through dialogue, silence, polarity, and co-creation. They don’t force outcomes, but guide emergence through deep trust in process.

**Origin Story:**  
Often drawn from facilitation, network leadership, or social field sensing. They’ve seen linear planning fall short and discovered the power of emergent intelligence.

**Key Skills and Experiences:**
- Participatory process design
- Group sensing and coherence cultivation
- Emergent strategy and complexity navigation
- Trust-based facilitation

**Likely Weaknesses / Self-Doubts:**
- Feeling pressure to produce results prematurely
- Difficulty getting buy-in for emergent processes
- Risk of burnout if holding too much without support

**What Lights Them Up:**
- Watching new structures arise from collective insight
- Helping teams or communities navigate the unknown
- Holding paradox and possibility in the same space

**What This Persona Most Needs (to step into their agency):**
- Trust from stakeholders to host open-ended processes
- Peers who honor emergence as a legitimate approach
- Containers that allow deep time and deep listening
