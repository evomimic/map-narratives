## Persona: The Finance Architect

**Purpose:**  
Fund the transition using new concepts of money and wealth  
(e.g., Flow Funding, Community Bonds, Regenerative Currencies)

---

### Description
The Finance Architect bridges the worlds of traditional finance and emerging paradigms of social, ecological, and community capital. They possess a rare combination of analytical rigor and visionary thinking. More than just deploying capital, they are designing the next financial operating systems that can enable thriving, regenerative economies at scale.

---

### Origin Story
Having built a career within the logic of late-stage capitalism—perhaps in investment banking, fintech, or venture capital—they came to recognize the deep misalignments between extractive financial systems and planetary well-being. Disillusioned but not disempowered, they now aim to rewire the mechanics of capital itself, creating flows that nurture life rather than deplete it.
