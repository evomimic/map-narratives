# Persona: HX Designer

**Purpose:**  
Craft holistic experience flows for human and ecosystem flourishing.

**Description:**  
The HX (Human Experience) Designer thinks beyond UI—they care about the full arc of experience: onboarding, relationships, rituals, coherence, and regeneration. They architect for aliveness, not just usability.

**Origin Story:**  
Often grew frustrated with product design that centered profit over people. Came to believe that *how* something feels is *what* it is—and now designs with that truth in mind.

**Key Skills and Experiences:**
- Experience design and service flow mapping
- Emotional and social design
- Ritual and interface choreography
- Human systems integration

**Likely Weaknesses / Self-Doubts:**
- Getting undervalued in engineering-heavy spaces
- Overwhelmed by edge cases or structural constraints
- Struggling to measure the impact of "feel"

**What Lights Them Up:**
- Designing flows that feel sacred, empowering, or joyful
- Creating coherence across a complex experience
- Helping people feel held, seen, and capable

**What This Persona Most Needs (to step into their agency):**
- Collaboration with developers and stewards
- Agency in shaping not just tools, but the emotional tone of MAP
- Ecosystem-wide prioritization of experience quality
