# Persona: Mapp Developer

**Purpose:**  
Build modular software capabilities to activate core MAP flows.

**Description:**  
The Mapp Developer is a technical contributor who creates the apps ("mapps") that agents use to navigate, co-create, and coordinate in the ecosystem. They work with protocols, UI scaffolds, and the MAP API to build generative tools.

**Origin Story:**  
Often came from open source or mission-driven tech spaces. Tired of building tools that served extractive ends, they now want to create tech aligned with life and agency.

**Key Skills and Experiences:**
- Software development and API integration
- UX/UI design collaboration
- Protocol thinking and modularity
- Familiarity with semantic or graph-based data models

**Likely Weaknesses / Self-Doubts:**
- Feeling removed from social/ecological impact
- Struggling to align tech timelines with participatory design
- Risk of burnout from under-scoped asks

**What Lights Them Up:**
- Shipping mapps that unlock meaningful flows
- Building tech that honors complexity and emergence
- Collaborating with designers, weavers, and stewards

**What This Persona Most Needs (to step into their agency):**
- Clear specs and real-world use cases
- A dev-friendly MAP stack and contribution path
- Cross-functional design collaborations
