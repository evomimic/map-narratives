## Persona: The Patron

**Purpose:**  
Fund the Transition

---

### Description
The Patron brings traditional financial capital into a transformative context. Having succeeded in the legacy economy, they now seek to redirect their resources toward systems that are equitable, regenerative, and future-resilient. Their wealth enables them to support initiatives that prototype new economic, social, and cultural architectures.

---

### Origin Story
The Patron amassed their fortune through conventional means—perhaps as a founder, investor, or executive in the late-stage capitalist economy. With rising awareness of systemic fragility, ecological limits, and social fractures, they’ve come to view the old model as unsustainable. They now seek to play a catalytic role in cultivating a new form of capital that centers **flows over hoarding**, **relationships over extraction**, and **regeneration over growth for its own sake**.

---

### Likely Weaknesses / Self-Doubts
- May **overestimate the applicability of business-as-usual strategies** to complex cultural transitions
- Tends to **center their own ideas or branding**, especially if they’ve previously led large initiatives
- Can unintentionally **reproduce extractive patterns** even in regenerative contexts
- Worries whether their money is truly making a difference, or if it's just “philanthropic theater”

### What Lights Them Up
- Tangible, visible **on-the-ground impact**
- Being part of something **visionary and historic**
- The sense of **legacy-building** beyond wealth
- **Human connection** with people enacting the change they fund
