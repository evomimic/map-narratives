???+ "Use Case Details"

    **Preconditions:**  
    - Agent is identified and addressable (e.g., via profile or credential)  
    - Inviting Agent has sufficient permissions in the Space  
    - Invitation mechanism is supported by the Space's LifeCode  

    **Post-conditions:**  
    - New Agent becomes a recognized member of the Space  
    - Roles or permissions may be assigned at time of joining  

    **Assumptions:**  
    - Joining may require acceptance of Space norms  
    - Notifications are sent to the invited Agent  
    - Some Spaces may allow open joining; others are invite-only  

    ### Main Flow
    1. Inviting Agent selects "Invite to Space" action  
    2. Target Agent receives a notification or prompt  
    3. Target Agent accepts, declines, or requests more info  
    4. Upon acceptance:
        a. Membership is registered  
        b. Optional Role(s) may be assigned  
        c. Space state is updated and notification logged  

    ### Wireframes
    - Invite modal with optional roles and welcome message  
    - Agent dashboard showing pending invitations  
    - Join confirmation UI with Space summary  

    ### GitHub Issues
    - [ ] Space membership schema and policies  
    - [ ] Role assignment UX on join  
    - [ ] Notification flow for invitations  

    ### Implementation Notes
    - Consider support for batch invites  
    - Lifecycle hooks for custom Space onboarding workflows
