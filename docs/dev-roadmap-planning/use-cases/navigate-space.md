# UC: Navigate Space

**Description:**  
An agent browses the contents of a Space, exploring holons, relationships, and activity. Navigation is typically graph-based â€” expanding or following relationship paths between holons, optionally filtered by type, tag, or role. Interfaces may include map-like visuals, graph viewers, lists, or guided flows.

**Ecosystem Relationships**

**Mapps Involved:**
- [MAP Navigator / Search](../mapps/map-navigator.md)
- [Geospatial Map Explorer](../mapps/geospatial-map-explorer.md)
- [Holon Gallery](../mapps/holon-gallery.md)
- [Holon Editor](../mapps/holon-editor.md)

**Holon Types:**
- [R] [Space](../holon-types.md#space)
- [R] [Holon](../holon-types.md#holon)
- [R] [SavedView](../holon-types.md#savedview)
- [R] [GraphVisualizer](../holon-types.md)
- [R] [CanvasVisualizer](../holon-types.md)

**Ecosystems Supported:**
- [Holonic Navigation & Visualization](../ecosystem-activation.md#2-global-meme-pool)
- [Living Systems Mapping](../ecosystem-activation.md#5-natural-resource-commons)

**Personas Likely Involved:**
- [Cartographer](../personas/cartographer.md)
- [Pattern Detective](../personas/pattern-detective.md)

???+ "Use Case Details"

    **Preconditions:**  
    - Agent is a member of or has view access to the Space  
    - Visualizers and Mapps are registered within the Space  

    **Post-conditions:**  
    - Agent discovers relevant holons, subgraphs, or perspectives  
    - Agent may save a view or initiate follow-on action (e.g. open Holon Editor)  

    **Assumptions:**  
    - Navigation follows holonic relationships (e.g. parent, linked, referenced)  
    - Filters (e.g. HolonType, tag, space) can be applied dynamically  

    ### Main Flow  
    1. Agent enters a Space via DAHN or Space Explorer  
    2. Chooses a navigation modality (e.g. graph, spatial map, gallery)  
    3. Applies filters or search terms (optional)  
    4. Expands or follows relationships to traverse the graph  
    5. Interacts with holons inline (e.g. open preview, drill-down)  
    6. Saves navigation state as a `SavedView` (optional)  

    ### Wireframes  
    - Interactive graph with link expansion and filtering  
    - Spatial map view with contextual overlays  
    - Saved view list with preview thumbnails  

    ### GitHub Issues  
    - [ ] Relationship-based graph traversal UI  
    - [ ] SavedView state persistence and recall  
    - [ ] Search + filter sidebar  

    ### Implementation Notes  
    - Navigation logic is often recursive and holon-type aware  
    - Canvas and Graph Visualizers work in tandem for UX consistency
