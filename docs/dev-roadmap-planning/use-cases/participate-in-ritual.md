# UC: Participate in Ritual

**Description:**  
An agent engages in a Ritual within a Space. Rituals are time-bound, intention-driven patterns of interaction that bring coherence, reflection, and shared meaning to collective experience. Participation may be synchronous or asynchronous and may include roles, offerings, and memetic elements.

**Ecosystem Relationships**

**Mapps Involved:**
- [Ritual Runner](../mapps/ritual-runner.md)
- [Notification Center](../mapps/notification-center.md)

**Holon Types:**
- [R] [Ritual](../holon-types.md#ritual)
- [R] [Event](../holon-types.md#event)
- [R] [Meme](../holon-types.md#meme)
- [R] [Space](../holon-types.md#space)

**Ecosystems Supported:**
- [Collective Intelligence Activation](../ecosystem-activation.md#1-empowered-agents-holarchy)
- [Living Systems Mapping](../ecosystem-activation.md#5-natural-resource-commons)

**Personas Likely Involved:**
- [Ritual Holder](../personas/ritual-holder.md)
- [Embodied Practitioner](../personas/embodied-practitioner.md)
- [Regenerative Actor](../personas/regenerative-actor.md)

???+ "Use Case Details"

    **Preconditions:**  
    - A Ritual has been defined and published in the Space  
    - Time and modality of participation are known to agents  
    - Agent has access to the Space and Ritual context  

    **Post-conditions:**  
    - Agent's participation is logged as an Event  
    - Ritual context is updated with outcomes, reflections, or responses  

    **Assumptions:**  
    - Rituals may be synchronous (e.g., Zoom call, circle) or asynchronous (e.g., journaling prompt)  
    - Some rituals are guided by roles or contain interactive segments  

    ### Main Flow  
    1. Agent is invited to participate via notification or discovery  
    2. Ritual Runner presents contextual prompt or structure  
    3. Agent engages according to the design (e.g., submits a reflection, joins a video call)  
    4. Participation is recorded and possibly shared in the Space  
    5. Post-ritual reflections or follow-ups are enabled  

    ### Wireframes  
    - Ritual timeline or journey flow  
    - Prompt + response interaction UI  
    - Reflections board or memetic wall  

    ### GitHub Issues  
    - [ ] Ritual execution engine (sync/async support)  
    - [ ] Integration with Event logging  
    - [ ] Notification + follow-up flows  

    ### Implementation Notes  
    - Ritual design patterns may evolve; consider templating  
    - Some rituals may be collective (multi-agent) while others are solo  
    - Support multiple types of prompts: text, video, emoji, meme, etc.
