# Use Case Model

This section provides an overview of the initial set of use cases that drive early MAP activation. It provides a concrete sense of what agents can actually use the MAP to do in its initial release.

The goal of this model is to support a **progressive emergence** of core capabilitiesâ€”starting from agent identity, growing into collaborative spaces, and seeding value-generating holonic structures.

- **[View Holons in Space](./view-holons-in-space.md):** Allows agents to explore the network of holons visible in a given space.
- **[Receive Notifications](./receive-notifications.md):** Delivers activity and update alerts across spaces and connected holons using preferred channels.
- **[Create/Edit Meme](./create-edit-meme.md):** Lets cultural contributors author, refine, and share memes representing values, stories, and principles.
- **[Browse Meme Pool](./browse-meme-pool.md):** Provides discovery tools to explore memes by tag, lineage, or contribution pattern.
