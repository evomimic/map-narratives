# Glossary

This glossary defines key terms used throughout the MAP architecture. Terms are interlinked to support deep conceptual coherence and easier navigation.


### Exosphere
*noun*

The **Exosphere** is the outermost, most inclusive AgentSpace in the MAP architecture. It is the thin, shared membrane of presence that includes **all agents and all AgentSpaces** by default—regardless of their level of commitment, trust, or governance maturity.

Every agent who has instantiated identity on the MAP is a member of the Exosphere, and every Social Organism, Agreement-based AgentSpace, and Personal I-Space exists *within* it. The Exosphere does not impose shared values or decision-making structures; it is not a commons, nor a community—it is a **permissive field of visibility** and possibility.

Agents place offers into the Exosphere when they wish to broadcast them to the widest possible audience. By contrast, more intentional spaces—built around shared purpose, trust scaffolding, and governance—emerge *within* the Exosphere, but are not reducible to it.

> The Exosphere is not where trust lives, but where it begins. It is the **default membrane of social potential** from which richer structures evolve.

## AgentSpace
An **AgentSpace** is a bounded context in which agents interact, co-create, and participate in value flows. Every AgentSpace has a [LifeCode](#lifecode) that defines its membrane—what promises are required to enter and what commitments exist within.

---

## LifeCode
A **LifeCode** (formerly “memetic signature”) is the identity and governance signature of an Agent or AgentSpace. It defines values, intentions, decision models, and expectations. In agreement-based spaces, the LifeCode may be derived from—but is not identical to—the [Agreement](#agreement).

---

## I-Space
An **I-Space** is the personal AgentSpace that every individual agent receives upon joining the MAP. It is where their LifeCode lives and where their values, aspirations, and offers originate.

---

## Agreement
An **Agreement** is a structured bundle of promises between agents. It may result in the creation of an [Agreement-Based AgentSpace](#agreement-based-agentspace), which includes all participants and defines the space of interaction.

See also: [Promise](#promise), [LifeCode](#lifecode)

---

## Promise
A **Promise** is a voluntary commitment made by one agent to another. Promises are the atomic units of coordination in MAP and are foundational to offers, agreements, and trust scaffolding.

See also: [Offer](#offer), [Agreement](#agreement)

---

## Offer
An **Offer** is a proposal containing promises an agent is willing to make and the reciprocal promises they expect. Offers are extended into [AgentSpaces](#agentspace) and can result in [Agreements](#agreement) if accepted.

See also: [Promise](#promise), [AgentSpace](#agentspace)

---

## Social Organism
A **Social Organism** is an Agentic AgentSpace with sufficient coherence, governance, and memetic identity to act as an autonomous agent in its own right. These are the living collectives that emerge within the Exosphere.
