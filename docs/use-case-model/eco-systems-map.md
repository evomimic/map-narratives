## 🧭 Core MAP MVP: Minimal Viable Mapps

Each “mapp” is a lightweight application/module that can be composed into flows or used independently. The goal here is agent empowerment and ecological coherence. These mapps together form the minimum viable "soil kit" for early adopters to sprout, orient, and begin co-creating.

### 1. Profile Manager
_“Who am I and how do I show up in this ecosystem?”_

- Define/edit personal identity fields (name, alias, avatar, bios, pronouns)
- Add geographic presence (linked to MAP’s geospatial layer)
- Link social handles, wallets, and credentials
- Set privacy/sharing preferences for each attribute

✅ Minimal viable identity and presence on the physical and digital MAP

### 2. Space Explorer
_“Where am I? What ecosystems, crews, or collectives am I part of—or could be?”_

- List of Spaces I belong to (crews, guilds, collectives, projects, events)
- Discovery of open/nearby/mission-aligned Spaces
- Spaces shown as cards or on a map (geographic, thematic, or cultural)
- Request to join, send message, explore public info

✅ Presence on the organizational and relational MAP

### 3. Holon Gallery
_“Let me explore the living building blocks of this ecosystem.”_

- View/search/select Holons in a given Space
- Cards with preview data, tags, last activity
- Filters by type (e.g. agent, meme, project, ritual, resource, tool, etc.)
- Relationship navigation (see connected holons, upstream/downstream)

✅ Surfacing structured elements of participation and meaning

### 4. Holon Editor
_“Let me make and shape the building blocks.”_

- Create new Holons (with minimal property scaffolding)
- View/edit core properties (title, description, type, tags, attributes)
- Add/remove related Holons (relationships: parent, child, peer, uses, linksTo, etc.)
- Version tracking and lineage support (basic to start)

✅ Enable co-creation and living structure evolution

### 5. Notification Center
_“Let me know what’s emerging across my networks.”_

- Unified inbox with pluggable channels (Email, SMS, WhatsApp, internal MAP messages)
- Notification preferences by Space, source, type, urgency
- Threaded updates, activity feed view
- Respond, mark complete, pin for later

✅ Signal awareness and actionable participation invitations

### 6. Calendar Adapter
_“What’s happening, when—and how do I coordinate across rhythms?”_

- Integrate with external calendars (Google, Outlook, Apple, etc.)
- View collective events across my Spaces
- Subscribe to Holon- or Space-specific calendars
- Optional: ritual time layers (lunar, seasonal, etc.)

✅ Provides the rhythmic pulse of the ecosystem—essential for collaboration

### 7. Geospatial Layer / MAP View
_“Where are people, places, and projects physically embodied?”_

- View agents, Spaces, and Holons on an interactive map
- Filter by type (projects, gatherings, assets)
- Layers toggle: physical, cultural (LifeCode resonance), event pins
- Draw “Zones of Interest” or “Living Bioregions”

✅ Embeds MAP in the living planet—critical for grounded coordination

### 8. MAP Navigator / Search
_“Let me search and move across the entire living MAP.”_

- Full-text and tag-based search across agents, memes, Spaces, Holons
- View search results in multiple lenses: list, map, relationship graph
- Save searches, subscribe to updates on queries

✅ Global awareness and connective insight

### 9. Ritual Runner (Optional but High-Leverage)
_“I want to run something meaningful with others.”_

- Pick a ritual/meme (e.g. Alignment Circle, Sprint Planning, Story Weaving)
- Auto-invite participants, set roles
- Track stages (instructions, contributions, outputs)
- Feed outputs back into the MAP (new Holons, media, insights)

✅ Ignites co-creation and fuels the memetic economy

### 10. Meme Pool Browser
_“What cultural material is alive, and how can I engage with it?”_

- Browse/search memetic Holons: values, principles, rituals, prompts, archetypes
- Filter by type, lineage, popularity, resonance
- View remix history, related Holons
- Bookmark or tag for future use

✅ Opens the memetic commons for exploration and remix

### 11. LifeCode Definer
_“What matters to me? What values and principles do I live by?”_

- Build a personal “LifeCode Stack” by selecting memes from the Global Meme Pool
- View alignment heatmaps between self and Spaces/crews
- Optional: “My Mythic Narrative” tool—compose a story using selected memes

✅ Cultural presence, values discovery, and ecosystem self-placement

### 12. Service Publisher
_“I want to offer a capability that others can use or compose.”_

- Define a service as a Holon with attributes (inputs, outputs, context)
- Attach interface methods or booking protocols
- Tag with use cases, domains, and types (e.g. async, 1:1, crew-scale)

✅ Turns roles and tools into composable ecosystem modules

### 13. Service Composer (Post-MVP Candidate)
_“Let me build a stack from what’s already here.”_

- Select and sequence services to create bundles or workflows
- View compatibility and dependency checks
- Package and share as “Service Stacks” or Ritual Bundles

✅ Unlocks powerful flows and reusability across contexts
